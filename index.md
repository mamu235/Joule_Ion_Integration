# Welcome to RoboJoule

We will be getting started with an ION MC motor controller, an Intel Joule, and Ubuntu to getthis project running.

1. Get an Intel Joule, flash the BIOS, and install Ubuntu. Those instructions can be found here: [https://sites.google.com/view/ubuntu-16-04-on-an-intel-joule/home](https://sites.google.com/view/ubuntu-16-04-on-an-intel-joule/home)

2. Once you have the Joule up and running, you will need to install [xfce](https://wiki.debian.org/Xfce), a Ubuntu desktop environment that is faster than Ubuntu Unity on the Joules. To do this follow these steps:
  1. Open a Terminal on your Joule and enter 'sudo apt-get install xfce4' and enter your password
